# ðŸ“’ Wallpkgs

> A potentially curated collection of wallpapers with various color palettes. Packaged 
with nix for ease of installation and referencing.

## Building

> Wallpkgs exposes a default package which you can build without extra args.

```console
# Build default package
$ nix build .
```

## Install 

> Wallpkgs can be installed on non-NixOS with nix profile install. Do note that this 
will copy the packages to your nix profile and not nix store.

```console
$ nix profile install .
```

> On NixOS, it's recommended that you add wallpkgs to your flake inputs.

```nix 
inputs = {
# ...
wallpkgs = "github:notashelf/wallpkgs";
};
```

## Using the wallpapers 

> The `wallpkgs` package moves included wallpapers to `$out/share/wallpapers` by 
default. You may reference those files at `$NIX_USER_PROFILE_DIR/share/wallpapers`
if they are installed via `nix profile install` (multi-user Nix), or reference the 
package path if installed via flake inputs with `${pkgs.wallpkgs}` inside NixOS 
configurations. 

## Contributing

**New Wallpapers**
> My vision for Wallpkgs is for it to be a community collection of Wallpapers. As such, 
new wallpapers are always welcome, whatever the theme. For the sake of organization and 
avoiding potential infringement, please do separate wallpapers based off of their distinctive 
features and give credit when it is due.

**Nix**
> I am nowhere near the best when it comes to Nix. This was meant to be a project for 
me to explore with as well as a wallpaper collection for me and others to use, and thus 
please do feel free to refactor/rewrite/add/remove any nix code as you see fit. PRs will ba 
reviewed with utmost interest. See [todo](../TODO) for my current list of to-do items.

## ðŸ“œ License issues 

> I will do my best to avoid infringing individual rights as much as possible. But given 
the nature of how I (and many others in the Linux & OSS community) find wallpapers, 
the authors may sometimes be ambigious. If you find any work here tha belongs to you, which 
you are share with the community with credits given, please [contact me](issues) and I will respond 
as soon as possible. 

> Contributors are kindly requested to specify source for wallpapers created by individual artists 
and published over the internet. If you cannot find the source, please leave a note.

Thanks for your understanding!
